create table if not exists public.scores (

  player     text not null check (char_length(player) between 1 and 24),
  score      integer not null check (score >= 0),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- Index to make "top scores" queries fast.
create index if not exists scores_score_desc_idx on public.scores (score desc);

-- Row Level Security: a public game leaderboard allows anyone (the anon key)
-- to read all scores and to insert their own. No update/delete is granted.
alter table public.scores enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "public can read scores" on public.scores;
create policy "public can read scores"
  on public.scores for select
  using (true);

drop policy if exists "public can insert scores" on public.scores;
create policy "public can insert scores"
  on public.scores for insert
  with check (score >= 0 and char_length(player) between 1 and 24);

-- NOTE: anon inserts are inherently spoofable from a client. For a casual
-- leaderboard this is fine. To harden against cheating, move score submission
-- behind an Edge Function / your own backend that validates the run, and
-- remove the public insert policy above.
